These llamas were known for their soft and colorful wool, which was highly prized by the humans who lived nearby.\\n\\nOne day, a particularly curious and adventurous llama named Luna decided to leave the safety of the valley and explore the world beyond. She had heard stories about other animals, cultures, and landscapes, and she was eager to see them for herself. With her adventurous spirit and sense of curiosity, she set off on her journey.\\n\\nLuna traveled through dense forests, across rocky terrain, and over sand dunes, meeting many different animals along the way. She would always take a moment to listen to their stories and learn about their unique perspectives and experiences. Luna became more and more enamored of the world outside the valley and decided to stay away from her previous home.\\n\\nAs she continued her journey, she came across a group of humans who were cutting down trees and clearing land for their own purposes. Luna was horrified at the destruction she saw and decided to intervene. She used her strong legs and powerful body to pull up the trees that had been cut and place them back in their original positions. The humans were amazed by this act and invited Luna to stay with them, which she did.\\n\\nLuna became a beloved member of the community and was often called upon when help was needed. She would pull carts, move heavy objects, or simply offer comfort and companionship to those in need. As time passed, Luna's fame spread far and wide, and she became a symbol of hope and perseverance for many.\\n\\nOne day, while pulling a particularly large log, Luna felt a sudden pain in her leg. She had been injured and was unable to continue her work. The humans around her were devastated and did everything they could to help Luna recover. They even built a special enclosure for her where she could rest and heal without fear of harm.\\n\\nLuna's injury healed, but she never returned to the same level of activity as before. She had become more selective about what tasks she would take on and spent more time just enjoying life.\"},\n","   'finish_reason': 'length'}],\n"," 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 32, 'completion_tokens': 480, 'total_tokens': 512}}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**1.
