# Beginner's Roadmap to GenAI with Hugging Face & Colab

![Alt text](hug.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Beginner Roadmap to GenAI with Hugging Face"! This resource is your gateway into the world of Generative AI (GenAI). It's designed for students, developers, AI enthusiasts, and anyone curious about AI's capabilities, guiding you from the basics to more advanced concepts in GenAI.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI (GenAI) is a branch of artificial intelligence dedicated to creating new digital content, including text, images, music, and more. These models use existing data to produce original content that mirrors their training material.

## Why Hugging Face?

Hugging Face leads the AI community with a robust, user-friendly platform. It offers an extensive collection of pre-trained models, making it an excellent starting point for beginners in GenAI.

## Using This Repository

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Google Colab Environment
- **Google Colab Introduction:** Access it at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- **Installing Hugging Face Transformers:** Execute `!pip install transformers` in a Colab notebook.
- **Google Drive Connection (Optional):** For managing data and models, follow the instructions in this [Google Colab Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KeJZBZGtYo).

### Step 2: Demystifying Large Language Model Cards
- **Explore Hugging Face Model Hub:** Visit [Hugging Face Models](https://huggingface.co/models).
- **Model Cards:** Understand models better through their model cards, like the [GPT-2 Model Card](https://huggingface.co/gpt2).

### Step 3: Downloading and Running Pre-trained Models in Colab
- **Choose a Model:** Start with GPT-2 for text generation.
- **Setup:** Load your chosen model and tokenizer.
- **Pipeline Creation:** Use Hugging Face's `pipeline` function for text generation.
- **Text Generation:** Experiment with different prompts.

Explore hands-on with the [GenAI Notebook](Text_generation_GPT2.ipynb).
