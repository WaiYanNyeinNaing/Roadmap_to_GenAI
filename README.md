![Alt text](hug.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Beginner Roadmap to GenAI with Hugging Face"! This repository is designed to be your starting point in the exciting world of Generative AI (GenAI). Whether you're a student, a developer, an AI enthusiast, or just curious about the possibilities of AI, this roadmap is tailored to guide you through the basics and into the more advanced aspects of GenAI.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI, or GenAI, refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, whether that be text, images, music, or any other form of digital media. These models learn from existing data to generate new, original content that resembles the training data.

## Why Hugging Face?

Hugging Face is at the forefront of the AI community, providing a robust, user-friendly platform for experimenting with, training, and deploying AI models. With its extensive collection of pre-trained models and easy-to-use interfaces, Hugging Face is an ideal platform for beginners to start their journey into GenAI.


## How to Use This Repository

Step 1: Setting Up Your Google Colab Environment

- Google Colab Introduction: Access Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment, at Google Colab.

- Installing Hugging Face Transformers: 
  Run !pip install transformers in a Colab notebook.

- Google Drive Connection (Optional): For data and model management, connect your Google Drive as per instructions in Google Colab Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KeJZBZGtYo).

Step 2: Demystifying Large Language Model Cards

- Exploring Hugging Face Model Hub: Visit Hugging Face Models to browse various models.
- Understanding Model Cards: Each model comes with a "model card" providing detailed information. (See the GPT-2 Model Card for an example.)

Step 3: Downloading and Running Pre-trained Models in Colab

- Select a Model: Example using GPT-2 for text generation.

- Model and Tokenizer Setup: Instructions on loading your chosen model and tokenizer in Colab.

Step 4: Testing the Text Generation Interface

- Setting Up the Pipeline: Create a text generation pipeline using Hugging Face's pipeline function.
- Generating Text: Experiment with different prompts and observe the model's responses.
